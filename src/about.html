          Kenneth is a born and raised fifth generation San Franciscan, living
          in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where there is plentiful sunshine,
          awesome rock climbing, skiing, and a shortage of places to enjoy
          good coffee.

          I work as a general purpose software developer, and can be hired to
          build large and small applications&#8212;particularly for the
          web&#8212;using a variety of technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also provide <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/digitalcoach">digital
          coaching</a> to help you or your company create an online presence
          and use technology to be more productive.

          I'm interested in the ways people and families interact with their
          community and environment (sub|urban planning), the ways organizations
          interact with their customers and stakeholders (social networks,
          having a clue), and the ways individuals interact with their
          projects and team members (process, methodology - specifically,
          the realm of software development).
        </p>
        <p>
          I went to culinary school, college, and graduate school - Tante
          Marie's, San Francisco State, and College of Notre Dame. I've
          worked as a cook, a bike messenger (#122 Silver Bullet), a
          carpenter, a high school teacher, and a software developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've made two human beings from scratch, and from the way they
          look you can tell my wife is a babe.

            As I started to collect all my &#8220;stuff,&#8221; in preparation
            for my GTD rehabilitation, I noticed that I&#8217;m hanging on to
            a lot of old magazines. Tons of old magazines. They all went into
            the recycling bin, save a few articles I clipped and
            filed. Amazing how much space that freed up in my small home
            office. Took only
